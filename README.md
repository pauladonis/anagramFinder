## Anagram finder project

## The Task

Your program should run on the command line and take one argument which is a filename that contains a large list of words separated by new lines. For example `this_is_my_program this_is_my_data_file.txt`.

This file should be re-organized so that the words that are anagrams of each other are all on one line separated by spaces.

## Language used

JavaScript + Node.js

To run the app.js file use to command `node app.js input.txt`.

The program will generate a `output.txt` file which will contain a new list of words with the anagrams listed on the same line separated by spaces.
